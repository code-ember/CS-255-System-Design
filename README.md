DriverPass Project Summary

# System Requirements:
DriverPass required a system that allows customers to:

Take driving exams

Register for classes

Set up appointments for driving training

# Strengths:
I excelled in creating diagrams that effectively describe the functionalities of the system.

# Areas for Improvement:
I would revise the UML Sequence and Class Diagrams, as I didn't fully grasp them until after submission.

# User Needs and Implementation:
I interpreted user needs by breaking down requirements into different scenarios and models, ensuring user needs were always the top priority. This approach helps create a system that addresses user problems and gathers valuable feedback.

# Design Approach:
My approach to designing software is a step-by-step process, allowing for quicker completion of working models.

# Future Strategies:
I would use the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process to create and clarify initial plans, designs, and implement systems efficiently.



# Who was the client? 
DriverPass is the client. 

# What type of system did they want you to design? 
DriverPass wanted a system that allows customers to take driving exams, register for classes, and setup appointments for driving training. 

# What did you do particularly well? 
I feel that I created the diagrams very well by describing the functionalities of the system. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? 
I interpret their needs by breaking down the requirements into different scenarios and models. 

# Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
It is always important to ensure user needs are always top priority, which is key for creating a system that will solve user problems and gain their feedback. 

# How do you approach designing software? 
The approach that I would use to designing software is a step-by-step approach, which allows for a faster way to get working models completed quickly. 

# What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 
I would use the SDLC process to help create and clarify initial plans, designs, and implementing systems quickly.
