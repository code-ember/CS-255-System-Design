## System Design

### System Requirements:
DriverPass required a system that allows customers to:
- Take driving exams
- Register for classes
- Set up appointments for driving training

### Strengths:
I excelled in creating diagrams that effectively describe the functionalities of the system.

### Areas for Improvement:
I would revise the UML Sequence and Class Diagrams, as I didn't fully grasp them until after submission.

### User Needs and Implementation:
I interpreted user needs by breaking down requirements into different scenarios and models, ensuring user needs were always the top priority. This approach helps create a system that addresses user problems and gathers valuable feedback.

### Design Approach:
My approach to designing software is a step-by-step process, allowing for quicker completion of working models.

### Future Strategies:
I would use the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process to create and clarify initial plans, designs, and implement systems efficiently.

### Who was the client?
DriverPass is the client.

### What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass wanted a system that allows customers to take driving exams, register for classes, and set up appointments for driving training.

### What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I created the diagrams very well by describing the functionalities of the system.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design?
I interpreted their needs by breaking down the requirements into different scenarios and models. This method ensured that the user’s needs were at the forefront of the design process.

### Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is always important to ensure user needs are the top priority. This is key for creating a system that will solve user problems and gather their feedback effectively.

### How do you approach designing software?
The approach that I would use to design software is a step-by-step method. This allows for a faster way to complete working models quickly.

### What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would use the SDLC process to help create and clarify initial plans, designs, and implement systems quickly.
