# CS-255-Projects


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project.

1. Who was the client? 
DriverPass is the client.

2. What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass wanted a system that allows customers to take driving exams, register for classes, and setup appointments for driving training.

3. What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I created the diagrams very well by describing the functionalities of the system.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? 
I would like to redo the UML Sequence and Class Diagrams.

5. How would you improve it?
I felt that I did not fully learn everything about the two diagrams till after turning them in.

6. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? 
I interpret their needs by breaking down the requirements into different scenarios and models.

7. Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is always very important to ensure user needs are always top priority, which is key for creating a system that will solve user problems and gain their feedback.

8. How do you approach designing software? 
The approach that I would use to designing software is a step-by-step approach, which allows for a faster way to get working models completed quickly.

9. What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 
I would use the SDLC process to help create and clarify initial plans, designs, and implementing systems quickly.
